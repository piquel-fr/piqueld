# Configuration

`piqueld` reads `/etc/piqueld/config.toml` when no option is supplied. An
explicit file is selected with:

```console
piqueld --config /path/to/config.toml
```

An explicitly supplied file must exist and pass validation; a missing or
invalid file is an error with its path included in the diagnostic. If the
production default file is absent, the daemon uses its validated built-in
defaults and explains how to select the repository's complete development
example with `--config examples/piqueld.toml`. The development example
keeps its state in `/tmp/piqueld-dev`, with its Unix API socket at
`/tmp/piqueld-dev-run/piqueld.sock`.

The daemon keeps persistent state in a private data directory: the embedded
database (`piqueld.db`) and future user data. Missing data-directory components
are created with mode `0700`; existing components are never chmodded.

The Unix API socket is separate, at `<runtime_dir>/piqueld.sock`. It is always
`0660`, owned by the daemon's user and effective group. Group membership grants
full deployment/operator access; authentication is not yet implemented.

The service manager or installer must create the runtime directory before
startup. Use daemon ownership and mode `0750` for group access, or `0700` for
private development. Group-readable/traversable runtime directories must use
the daemon's effective group. Group write and all access by others are rejected.
Both paths reject symlinks and ancestors vulnerable to replacement by untrusted
users. Both final directories must grant their owner read, write, and execute
access. Existing directory permissions are never changed.

For the development example, run `mkdir -p -m 0700 /tmp/piqueld-dev-run` first;
`just dev` handles this automatically. The production defaults are:

| Setting | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `server.data_dir` | `/var/lib/piqueld` |
| `server.runtime_dir` | `/run/piqueld` (must already exist) |
| `server.listen_mode` | `"off"` |
| `server.port` | `7845` |
| derived socket path | `<runtime_dir>/piqueld.sock` |
| derived database path | `<data_dir>/piqueld.db` |
| `docker.socket` | `/var/run/docker.sock` |
| `docker.auto_initialize_swarm` | `true` |
| `ingress.enabled` | `false` (restart required) |
| `reconciliation.scan_interval_seconds` | `60` |
| `reconciliation.prepare_timeout_seconds` | `300` |
| `reconciliation.convergence_timeout_seconds` | `120` |
| `retention.event_days` | `30` (`0` disables event pruning, independently of operations) |
| `retention.finished_operation_days` | `10` (`0` disables pruning; terminal operations older than the cutoff are pruned during each reconciliation cycle) |

Reconciliation intervals and timeouts are bounded to `1..=86400` seconds.
One async controller overlaps pending work. Internal global limits allow two
image resolutions, eight observations, and one resource mutation request. Timers
consume no I/O slot. These limits are not configurable.

The data directory is the only persistent daemon state. The daemon holds
exclusive OS locks on both directories for its lifetime. Separate instances
require separate data and runtime directories. A competing process fails before
opening the database or replacing a socket. Process exit (including a crash)
releases the locks; there are no lock files to remove.

The runtime directory is dedicated to piqueld. Its lock coordinates cooperating
daemon instances, and its permissions prevent operator-group members from
replacing entries. Processes running as the daemon user or root must also honor
the lock; an unrelated process with that identity can otherwise replace the
socket during recovery. The lock is not an isolation boundary between processes
sharing the daemon's identity.

Under the runtime lock, startup probes an existing socket. An active listener is
left untouched; a connection-refused socket is removed and rebound. Unexpected
files, symlinks, timeouts, and other probe errors stop startup without replacing
the path. Both listeners are bound before reconciliation starts.

The CLI now defaults to `/run/piqueld/piqueld.sock`; it does not fall back to the
old state-directory socket. Existing custom installations must prepare a runtime
directory and update their configuration. CLI socket overrides and profiles
remain available for custom locations.

The dashboard is not configurable at runtime: it is embedded when the daemon
is built with the `embedded-ui` cargo feature and absent otherwise. It is
served on the TCP listener only, so a TCP listen mode must be enabled to reach
it; the Unix API socket serves the API alone.

`[build_history]` bounds persisted build output: `log_max_bytes` defaults to
4194304 (maximum 64 MiB), and `log_retention_days` to 30 (1–3650). Build metadata
remains until the application is deleted. Expiration removes output chunks while
retaining the attempt and an explicit expired indicator.

## TCP listen modes and Tailscale

`server.listen_mode` selects `off` (Unix socket only), `localhost` (127.0.0.1
and ::1), `tailscale` (the host's Tailscale IPv4 and IPv6 addresses), or `both`.
Every selected TCP address uses `server.port`, which must be 1–65535. The Unix
socket remains available in every mode. The old `server.http_listen` setting is
rejected; replace it with `listen_mode` and `port`.

For remote access, install and connect Tailscale on the daemon host and client:

```toml
[server]
listen_mode = "tailscale"
port = 7845
```

At startup, piqueld runs `tailscale status --json --peers=false` with a five-second
timeout. If the command is missing, fails, or reports Tailscale is not running
or has no addresses, piqueld logs a warning and continues with the remaining
listeners. It never retries discovery: restart piqueld after bringing Tailscale
up or changing its addresses. Any actual bind failure aborts startup, including
a failure on just one address. Direct binding requires Tailscale's normal network
interface; userspace-only networking is not supported.

The tailnet is trusted like localhost: anyone who can reach the API has full
operator access. Use tailnet policy to control who can connect. HTTP traffic
between tailnet nodes is encrypted by Tailscale; piqueld does not manage HTTPS,
Tailscale Serve, enrollment, or certificates. Set `listen_mode = "localhost"`
to remove the Tailscale listener, or `"off"` for Unix-socket-only access, and
restart the daemon. Independently configured proxies can still expose localhost.

## Managed application ingress

`[ingress] enabled = true` enables the installation-owned Caddy gateway on TCP
ports 80/443. This setting is read once at startup and is read-only in the UI.
Enabling requires Docker Engine 28+ and API 1.48+; the daemon reports gateway
startup, port conflicts, and version failures through ingress health without
stopping application management. Application images' own ports remain private.

Restart after changing the TOML. With ingress enabled, stopping piqueld leaves
Caddy serving independently. Restarting piqueld with ingress disabled removes the
managed gateway container and its restart policy, closing public listeners while
retaining route intent, reservations, and certificates. No DNS or certificate work
runs while disabled. Re-enabling restores deployed routes, including deployments
made while disabled, without activating saved-but-undeployed changes.

Gateway certificates, accepted configuration, and the private administration socket
live below `<data_dir>/ingress`. Only dedicated subdirectories are mounted into
Caddy; it receives neither the Docker socket nor the daemon API socket/database.
See [ingress](ingress.md) for DNS, networking, lifecycle, and status details.
